![Overview of Results](ressources/results-overview.png)

Large-scale evaluation of neural network language models as predictive models of human language processing. This
pipeline compares dozens of state-of-the-art models and 4 human datasets (3 neural, 1 behavioral). It builds on
the [Brain-Score](www.Brain-Score.org) framework and can easily be extended with new models and datasets.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mschrimpf/neural-nlp.git
cd neural-nlp
pip install -e .
```

You might have to install nltk by hand / with conda.

## Run

To score gpt2-xl on the Blank2014fROI-encoding benchmark:

```bash
python neural_nlp run --model gpt2-xl --benchmark Blank2014fROI-encoding --log_level DEBUG
```

Other available benchmarks are e.g. Pereira2018-encoding (takes a while to compute), and Fedorenko2016v3-encoding.

You can also specify different models to run -- note that some of them require additional download of weights (
run `ressources/setup.sh` for automated download).

## Data

When running a model on a benchmark, the data will automatically be downloaded from S3 (
e.g. https://github.com/mschrimpf/neural-nlp/blob/master/neural_nlp/benchmarks/neural.py#L361 for the Pereira2018
benchmark). Costly ceiling estimates have also been precomputed and will be downloaded since they can take days to
compute.

## Precomputed scores

Scores for models run on the neural, behavioral, and computational-task benchmarks are also available, see
the [`precomputed-scores.csv`](precomputed-scores.csv) file. You can re-create the figures in the paper using
the [`analyze`](neural_nlp/analyze/__main__.py) scripts.
